# Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Project Overview

This project is designed to put the skills we learned in Udacity's Object Oriented JavaScript course to practice. We were provided with both visual assets and a game loop engine. It was our task to build out this Frogger-based game using prototypal inheritance and delegation.

## Getting Started

Clone the following repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kklumpp13/udacity-fed-arcade-clone.git
```

Simply open the index.html file in your browser to begin playing.

## How to Play
Use the keyboard arrows to navigate across the road. If you make it to the river without running into any bugs, you'll earn a point and get a chance to try again. If you run into a bug, you'll lose a point and have to start over.


### Potential Improvements
* Choose player before starting the game
* Cap the number of times you can hit a bug
* Collect jewels for additional points
* Create levels of difficulty
* Improve flexibility of code by removing set width and length values
